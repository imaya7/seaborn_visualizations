# Explaination of heat map for elementary school students
# This is a heatmap, which is like a colorful picture that shows the difference in pulse rates during different exercise activities. Â 
# Each row of the heatmap is represented as a person and each column is a time interval (1 min, 15 min, and 30 min) that the pulse was measured.
# The colors on the heatmap tell us how fast or how slow the heartbeats were during different times. 
# The brighter the color is the faster the heartbeats are and the darker the color is the slower the heartbeats are.
# If you look at the heatmap, you can see that the heartbeats were faster at 1 minute and then got slower at 15 minutes and 30 minutes.
# This means that when we exercise, our heart beats faster at first and then slows down as we keep exercising.
# There are a few outliers to this if you look at the heatmap, we can also see that some people's heart rates didnt change as much as others.
# This could mean they may be in better shape than the other participants or they may not be trying as hard as the other participants.

# Explaination of the categorical plot for elementary school students
# This is a box plot that shows how the heartbeats were different for different types of exercises and diets.
# Each box represents the heartbeats of a group of people who did the same type of exercise and had the same diet.
# The line in the middle of the box is the average heartbeats for that group.
# During each of the three time intervals (1 min, 15 min, and 30 min), we can see how the heartbeats changed for different types of exercises and diets.
# The no fat diet group had the highest pulse rates across all three time intervals, while the high fat diet group had the lowest pulse rates.
# This means that diet can influence how fast our heart beats when we exercise, since the no fat diet group had the highest pulse rates 
# no matter the exercise type, while the high fat diet group had the lowest pulse rates no matter of the exercise type.
# Also the running group had the highest pulse rates no matter of the diet type, while the rest had the lowest pulse rates no matter of the diet type. 
# This means that running takes more energy and makes the heart beat faster than the other exercises.
